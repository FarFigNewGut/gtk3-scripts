== About

This is the beta GTK3 Lich repository.

== Revisions

This will contain multiple awkward revisions at first.  These awkward edits are an attempt to capture all of the versions shared across multiple git repositories.

The rough order of revisions will be:

* Current GTK2 - https://github.com/matt-lowe/Lich
* Dragonrealms GTK2 - https://github.com/dragon-realms/dr-lich
* Beta GTK3
* MacOS working Lich

After this, attempts to merge all existing code and create a semi-final product.
