== About

Scripts located here are the GTK3 versions of existing lich scripts.

The intent is to make these available until such time as people have converted fully onto the GTK3 version of lich.  Once this has been accomplished, these scripts should all be converted over to the primary Eol/scripts repository for general consumption and maintenance.

== Usage

To enable this repository you must use jinx.  This is a netlify enabled repository for jinx download:
* gtk3.elanthia.online
